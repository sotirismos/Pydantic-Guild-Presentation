# Pydantic Guild Presentation

The **Pydantic Guild Presentation repository** was created as part of an internal presentation at Satori (previous employer) to showcase the benefits of using Pydantic. The goal was to highlight its usefulness in data validation and settings management while providing a foundation for integrating Pydantic into our projects.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **Notebooks**:
  - `1. Type Hints.ipynb`: Introduction to Python's type hints and their significance.
  - `2. Performance.ipynb`: Analysis of Pydantic's performance in data validation.
  - `3. Serialization.ipynb`: Demonstrations of data serialization and deserialization with Pydantic.
  - `4. Json Schema.ipynb`: Exploration of JSON Schema generation from Pydantic models.
  - `5. Strict Mode.ipynb`: Insights into Pydantic's strict mode for enhanced validation.
  - `6. Data Classes.ipynb`: Comparison between Python's `dataclass` and Pydantic's `BaseModel`.
  - `7. Custom Validators.ipynb`: Guide on creating custom validators in Pydantic.
  - `8. Bonus.ipynb`: Additional tips and advanced features of Pydantic.
  - `Minimize LLM Hallucinations with Pydantic Validators.ipynb`: Techniques to reduce large language model hallucinations using Pydantic validators.
  - `Steering Large Language Models with Pydantic.ipynb`: Strategies to guide large language models using Pydantic.

- **Scripts**:
  - `3. Meltemi Talk.py`: Script associated with the third notebook.
  - `4. Simple FastAPI.py`: Example of integrating Pydantic with FastAPI.

- **Directories**:
  - `fastapi-microservice/`: Contains a FastAPI microservice example utilizing Pydantic for data validation.
